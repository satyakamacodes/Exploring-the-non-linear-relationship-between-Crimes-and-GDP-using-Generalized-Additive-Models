# Exploring-the-non-linear-relationship-between-Crimes-and-GDP-using-Generalized-Additive-Models
This repository contains the script and figures of the conference paper selected for presentation at the Latin American Conference of Computationa Intelligence 2018. The abstract of the paper is as follows: Crime is an important social and economic problem of South Africa. Though certain categories of crimes are of serious proportions, yet on aggregate the overall crime situation in the country has considerably improved in the last decade or so. A number of previous studies across other countries have shown a positive or negative relationship between crime and economic growth. On a microeconomic/provincial scale, this paper studies the relationship between various categories of crimes and economic growth using the non-linear modeling technique of Generalized Additive Models. Such a modeling approach helps in understanding how various categories of crimes complexly affect GDP.
